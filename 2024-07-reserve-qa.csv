validation-12,QA Report,one misleading comment isn't satisfactory quality,Unsatisfactory,37,
validation-115,QA Report,"invalid finding, StRSR is an ERC20 so it must have the approve() function",Unsatisfactory,42,

validation-8,Gas Optimizations,only 1 insufficient quality finding,Unsatisfactory,10,
validation-70,QA Report,"DutchTrade price does not go below ""worstPrice"" which according to definition is acceptable (if other sequencer findings are accepted I think this can be raised to Med), and msg.sender finding alone is unsatisfactory for a QA report",Unsatisfactory,18,
